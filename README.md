## This is a repository for testing github actions and workflows.

Following the [tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart) on github actions.

Workflows are stored in the `.github/workflows` directory in a `.yml` file. A workflow creates a runner (virtual machine) in which the commands are executed.
They are used for
- [building and testing](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests)
- [deploying](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment)
- various github routine [automatization](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-issues-and-pull-requests)
